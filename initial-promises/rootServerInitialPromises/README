This folder contains the promises to install on a newly installed Rudder root server. They will temporarily perform basic actions, until the Rudder web application generates promises for the root server (these will then be copied automatically).

These promises are generated by running Rudder with a "demo" config, and removing some elements from the generated promises. The patch file applied is in this directory.
